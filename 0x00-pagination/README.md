# 0x00. Pagination - Backend

This project introduces the concept of pagination in backend development, essential for managing large datasets and providing efficient data access in RESTful APIs. Here, you'll learn how to paginate datasets with simple parameters, utilize hypermedia for enhanced metadata, and implement pagination that's resilient to item deletions.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Implement simple pagination using `page` and `page_size` parameters.
- Design a paginated API with hypermedia metadata (HATEOAS).
- Create pagination that remains stable even when items are deleted.

## Concepts Covered

### 1. Simple Pagination with `page` and `page_size` Parameters

Simple pagination involves breaking down a dataset into discrete pages. In this approach:

- **`page`**: Specifies which page of the dataset to retrieve.
- **`page_size`**: Defines the number of items per page.

For instance, a request with `page=2` and `page_size=5` will return the second set of five items in the dataset. This is a common and straightforward way to manage large datasets in a way that minimizes memory usage and reduces the load on the server.

### 2. Pagination with Hypermedia Metadata (HATEOAS)

HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) extends basic pagination by providing additional metadata. This metadata can include:

- **Links to Previous and Next Pages**: Helps users navigate more easily between pages.
- **Total Page Count and Item Count**: Offers an overview of the dataset size.
- **Current Page Information**: Indicates the current page and page size.

By implementing HATEOAS, you enhance the user experience by embedding navigational links in the API responses, allowing clients to interact with the API more dynamically without needing additional hardcoded links.

### 3. Deletion-Resilient Pagination

When items are removed from a dataset, maintaining a consistent pagination structure becomes challenging. To ensure that page structure remains stable, consider these techniques:

- **Unique Identifiers**: Use unique identifiers for each item and manage pagination based on these IDs rather than index positions, which may shift upon deletions.
- **Offset and Limit-Based Pagination**: Store an offset value alongside the limit (similar to page and page size) so that missing items are handled dynamically without affecting the order.
  
Deletion-resilient pagination is especially helpful in applications where records frequently change or are removed, ensuring users experience minimal disruption.

## Project Structure

### Requirements

- **Python Version**: Python 3.7
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- **Style Guide**: `pycodestyle` (version 2.5.\*)

### Code Style

- Ensure all files end with a new line.
- Use `#!/usr/bin/env python3` at the start of every Python file.
- Include documentation for all modules, functions, and coroutines, detailing the purpose and usage.
- Type annotations are mandatory for all functions and coroutines.

### Documentation

- The `README.md` file (this file) is located at the root of the project.
- Each module and function should have clear, complete documentation for both purposes and usage.

### Testing

- File lengths and structure can be verified with `wc`.
